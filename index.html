                Hi, I'm hexxdgrl, or Lyra! Welcome to my little site about,
                well, me! Anything I like to do and post online will probably
                end up here.
            </p>

        <div class="box">
            <h1>about me</h1>
            <p>
                I've been an on and off "developer" for as long as I can
                remember. I'm still very inexperienced, but with all the
                projects I've been giving myself, that inexperience has slowly
                but surely chipped away. I make music, draw, build keyboards,
                work on cars, and soon to be planes. I play a lot of games,
                anything you can think of basically. I use linux (arch ofc) and
                you can find my config files
                <a href="https://github.com/hexxdgrl/.dotfiles">here</a> on my
                github! I love to customize everything, and you may notice my
                site matches my desktop ^u^ !! If you want to find out what I'm
                up to, go ahead and browse the sidebar.

            <h1>where to find me</h1>
            <p style="text-align: center">
                I stay away from socials, but you can contact me here:

                Maybe I'll have an irc and an email linked here at some point,
                but we'll see :p
