                Currently, I'm using a CRKBD Corne Rev 3 with a combination
                miryoku and engram layout pictured here:

            <p>
                I have been using this "MiryoGram" layout for about a week.
                Though this isn't the first time I've used a new layout, [in the
                past I switched from QWERTY to Colemak...] I'm still struggling
                to adjust to such a drastic change in layout :'3. I have another
                "splayed" style board in the works right now, and I will have
                pictures and a build log in the near future...

                As of now, I have a new board in the works, a KLOR (designed bo
                GEIGEIGEIST, and you can find that keeb
                <a href="https://github.com/geigeigeist/klor">here</a>.) I
                decided to go with the "polydactyl" layout, with an extra pinky
                row and an additional key on the thumb cluster. I found the
                Corne's extra column of three keys when you're already playing
                extend-o pinky just to hit the At or Grave key to be incredibly
                annoying.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have the "new" layout for this keyboard pictured below and
                when the time comes, the pictures of the completed build.

                When I decided too go full ergo, apparently I wanted too disrupt
                my muscle memory as much as possible. I switched from a 60% with
                Colemak with a single modified key to a 40% split ortho with
                homerow mods and a lot of swapped hand placements. I've noticed
                by far the most difficult habit of mine to break has been my MM
                of the Colemak homerow, as I'm constantly performing rolls that
                aren't there and reaching for the wrong keys.
