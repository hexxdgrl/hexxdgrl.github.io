            Jumping into this, I knew I wanted an split ortho layout, finger
            splay, and at least 42 keys. Size wasn't really a concern for me
            given this is going to be a home office board, and almost every
            split ortho 40% out there takes up less space than your standard
            ANSI-10X keyboards, not to mention the other layouts.
        </p>
        <p>
            After trawling the web (mostly reddit), I almost went with the
            Hillside; another splayed, split-ortho keyboard; but after scrolling
            one comment down, i found it... the KLOR. It looked absolutely
            perfect and fit my requirements exactly. So, 100$ later, the PCB and
            all the other junk io need is now its way here.
        </p>
        <p>
            As of now, the PCB remains in transit, and as such I have been
            relegated to making anything I can premptively. First order of
            business: deiciding a colour scheme.

            This was easy enough, I just took my linux config colors, headed
            down to microcenter and tried to get the closest resin color matches
            I could. Dark blue for the case, light blue for the caps. I have
            limited time and access to my resin printer, so all I was able to
            finish this first week was the keycaps, though I think they came out
            absolutely fantastic.
