                Currently, I'm using a CRKBD Corne Rev 3 with a combination
                miryoku and engram layout.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been using this "MiryoGram" layout for about a week.
                Though this isnt the first time I've used a new layout, [in the
                past I switched from QWERTY to Colemak...] I'm still struggling
                to adjust to such a drastic change in layout :'3. I have another
                "splayed" style board in the works right now, and I will have
                pictures and a build log in the near future...
            </p>

        <div class="box infoBox">
            <h1>current projects</h1>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, the KLOR board was a bust, which is a real damn
                shame, but that failure has indeed inspired me to create my own
                board. You can find more about it in the swallowtail section!!
