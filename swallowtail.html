                This is an ongoing project and this page probably wont be
                complete for a fair while... keep checking back if you're
                interested! All the config files, kicad files, etc. are in
                <a href="https://github.com/hexxdgrl/swallowtailkb"
                    >the github repo</a
                >
                if you're looking for those! This is just somewhere for me to
                write out what I did to make it !

            <p>
                I started designing this board as I was frustrated with my
                failure to assemble a PCB kit (lol, I know). I didn't want to
                spend that money on <i>another</i> PCB kit, so I figured... why
                not make my own? I started with
                <a href="https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen">ergogen</a>, a
                fantastic and relatively speaking easy to use tool.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a <i>lot</i> of tinkering, I came up with the first
                design, a non-split with MX switches as thats what im used to.

            <p>
                You can definitely see where the name comes from. However, I
                decided to go a different route. I really enjoy having a split
                board, so I designed a split version. It uses choc switches, a
                first for me despite the many, MANY keyboards I've built over
                the last 5 years.
            </p>
            <img src="images/ergogen_split.png" alt="split keyboard" />
            <p>
                The PCB for the split (the only PCB I've routed so far) took a
                lot of iterations, and a lot of trial and error. However, the
                PCB files have been sent off for manufacture and are en-route to
                me as this is being typed.
            </p>

                src="images/kicad_split.png"
                alt="kicad board router view of the split pcb"
            />
            <p>
                I am extremely happy with the way the board looks on the screen
                and I am absolutely ecstatic to see it in RL.
