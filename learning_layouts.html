            <h2>week one</h2>
            <p>
                When I decided too go full ergo, apparently I wanted too disrupt
                my muscle memory as much as possible. I switched from a 60% with
                Colemak with a single modified key to a 40% split ortho with
                homerow mods and a lot of swapped hand placements. I've noticed
                by far the most difficult habit of mine to break has been my MM
                of the Colemak homerow, as I'm constantly performing rolls that
                aren't there and reaching for the wrong keys.

            <h2>week two</h2>
            <p>
                my muscle memory has adapted much more in the past week and my
                WPM (on a typing test) hovers around 30 wpm. However, my
                accuracy is only about 92% :(.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ironically enough, by far my most missed letters are those on
                the home row.

            </div>
            <p>
                I also did some custom excercises to help with finger placement,
                that's why the graph has that spike and then hard drop in both
                WPM and accuracy.
