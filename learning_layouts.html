            <p>
                When I decided too go full ergo, apparently I wanted too disrupt
                my muscle memory as much as possible. I switched from a 60% with
                Colemak with a single modified key to a 40% split ortho with
                homerow mods and a lot of swapped hand placements. I've noticed
                by far the most difficult habit of mine to break has been my MM
                of the Colemak homerow, as I'm constantly performing rolls that
                aren't there and reaching for the wrong keys.

                my muscle memory has adapted much more in the past week and my
                WPM (on a typing test) hovers around 30 wpm. However, my
                accuracy is only about 92% :(.

            <p>
                Ironically enough, by far my most missed letters are those on
                the home row.

            <p>
                I also did some custom excercises to help with finger placement,
                that's why the graph has that spike and then hard drop in both
                WPM and accuracy.

            <h1>month two</h1>
            <p>
                Throughout the whole of the first month I made a lot of rapid
                progress, but now moving into the second month of learning
                engram, its slowed a fair bit. I've still gone up to the high
                60s in wpm, but of course im not seeing those huge daily jumps
                in speed like in the first few weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
                One big change I've made since the last update was switching to
                monkeytype from keybr, and sprinkling in a few games of
                typeracer to see how I stack up against others. I find
                monkeytype a lot better for improving my raw speed compared to
                keybr, though I am not entirely sure why. Maybe I just like the
                layout more XD

                Almost half a year into this project (holy fuck lmao) I have
                stagnated a little, probably due to the other projects (like
                making my own keyboard), fucking with the layout and whatnot,
                but I have hit a bit of a plateau of around 70wpm:
            </p>
            <img src="images/month3x_speed.png" />
            <p>
                You can see a bit of a dip and thats where I swapped to the new
                layout (and I also haven't really practiced in a while whoops),
                but I'm getting back up to my pre-switch speed, as the new board
                fits a lot better to my hands. (No shade to the corne, the
                swallowtail is literally just designed to fit my hands XD)
